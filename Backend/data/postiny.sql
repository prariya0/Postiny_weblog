(1, 4, 2, 'Fact: Retro Video Game Cover Art Rocked', 'Who doesn\'t immediately feel their nostalgia sense tingling whenever they think about good old video game box art? That\'s not just because it absolutely owned; it\'s also because the industry seems to have sadly given up on making sick-ass art to promote their games. With this, we\'re not saying that all retro box art was museum-worthy. A considerable portion of it definitely wasn\'t, but we can\'t help but feel like we\'re getting a disservice when even hilariously bad art gets replaced by no art at all. Most game box art/covers nowadays are just a CG render of the main character, making them mostly interchangeable noise. Many blame the trend on how the industry has greatly shifted from physical copies to digital ones, but there\'s more to it. It was long before we all fell under Steam\'s rule that game developers started slacking off in the box art department.\r\n\r\nWhat better example than the cover art of Final Fantasy VI for the SNES. It featured art by Yoshitaka Amano that beautifully showed the game\'s main character and world.\r\n\r\nThat\'s not even the worst offender, but it began the trend of featuring a bland CGI render instead of some sweet-looking art. Ok, we know that the idea of using some lush painting to promote games that can in no way match what\'s on the box was essentially a scam, but it was a scam that we only fell for/had our parents falling for once. After popping the cartridge in, we got disappointed that the beautifully detailed characters turned out to be just simple sprites, but if the game was good enough, that was just fine. Even as kids, we very quickly learned that no actual gameplay could match what was on the box.', 'Gaming-6.jpg', 1, '2022-05-15 14:00:33', '2022-05-15 14:00:33'),

Recently, the internet celebrated a landmark event as Rick Astley\'s \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" got its one billionth hit on YouTube -- not counting the billions of times the video has been furiously shut off within the first five seconds. And that\'s not the only way the trifling billion views are unrepresentative of the song\'s pervasiveness.

Once you open your newest skincare or makeup find, the clock starts ticking—and honestly, sometimes the countdown begins before you even open it.\r\n\r\nHave you been holding on to some products for years? Trust me, you’re not alone (I know I’m guilty). But, as the weeks and months go by, the half-finished bottles are slowly losing their efficacy. Using expired beauty products may seem harmless—sometimes, it just means they’re less effective. Other times, however, they can lead to unwelcome skin irritation, reactions, and infections.\r\n\r\nA few different factors contribute to a product’s shelf life, including the formula, ingredients, packaging, and storage method. Due to a lack of regulations, a clear expiration date can’t always be found (thanks, FDA!), so we’re breaking it down for you. And anyway, what better time to refresh your beauty cabinet than with spring approaching?\r\n\r\nHow can I keep track of expiration dates?\r\nWe know that was a lot of information but better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to skin health! Here are some quick ways to stay on top of these dates. While it may not always be available, keep a lookout for the period-after-opening (PAO) symbol that identifies the lifetime of a cosmetic product after it’s been opened. In case you haven’t noticed it before, the symbol looks like an open container with a time limit on it, like 12M or 24M. Also, click to download and print out our graphic below and have it handy. And, if you’re anything like us and like to stay organized, you can use stickers or tape to keep note of when you open products and how long they should be good for.

And at the pinnacle of that contradictory logic stands Jandek, who isn\'t just the most famous non-famous musician but also the most non-musical musical one.\r\n\r\nIt takes a lot of skill to make a good song, but it takes even more to make a song that\'s intentionally bad in a good way. This is the musical talent of Jandek. Working under the equally mysterious label of Corwood Industries, Jandek is a musician/band/weird outsider art project that has been shrouded in mystery for over 40 years. Having given only two interviews (reluctantly) over their entire career, Jandek\'s mantra is to shun the limelight, letting their music speak for itself. And it has a lot to say. Since 1978, Jandek has released over one hundred albums and singles, often just shipping crates of them out to DJs and lucky fans, telling them to pass them along as they see fit.\r\n\r\nSo what kind of music does Jandek play? That\'s a tough question.

Round, owlish glasses would likely be perched on his nose, a balding pate of salt-and-pepper hair. A comfortably fitted sports jacket, in one of the intellectual fabrics, like tweed or a ball of worsted wool. All I’m saying is, in my mind’s eye, on a spectrum of Anthony Kiedis to Bob Balaban, they’d be heavily, heavily swung towards the Balaban side of things.\r\nEven when I was told that Danny Elfman performed at Coachella, this broad image persisted. I would have expected that same nebbish fellow to be shrunk behind a large organ or piano, or conducting an orchestra with subtle flicks of a wand. What I definitely did not expect was for Danny Elfman to be absolutely, undeniably ripped and covered in tattoos, with an electric guitar slung over his shoulder. At first, I figured the picture I was looking at was some reunion tour of a 90s grunge act, one of the few ones where the former frontman actually aged gracefully. I expected Philip Seymour Hoffman and I got redheaded Chris Cornell.\r\nThis is the (68-YEAR-OLD) guy who composed the Simpsons theme song and did the score for Good Will Hunting?

That instrument is called a glass harp, and it\'s existed for centuries, longer than many more legitimate instruments. In 1761, Benjamin Franklin looked at the glass harp and thought, \"That\'s cool. But let\'s see if we can make this work without all that water.\"\r\nHe made an instrument that uses differently-shaped glasses but is piled horizontally so they all spin on a shared spindle. As with the glass harp, you run your fingers over the rims to make music. Franklin named the device the armonica. Today, it\'s more often called a glass harmonica, but it\'s not a variant of the harmonica—the harmonica wouldn\'t be invented till decades later.\r\nSo, Ben Franklin invented a musical instrument. Cool, cool. That would be the end of the story, except that people were convinced that the armonica drove them mad. \r\nThere is something distinct about the sounds the armonica makes. Franklin called them \"incomparably sweet beyond those of any other.\" Other people said it stimulates the nerves too much, enough to rip your mind apart. One professional harmonica player grew depressed, and the strange sounds received the blame. \r\nOne modern explanation for the armonica\'s effects is that it was made of lead glass, and so those who often played it suffered from lead poisoning. Another explanation says that it produces tones with a unique frequency that the human ear doesn\'t normally associate with sound, leading you to become disoriented, nauseous, or worse. Neither of these explanations stands up to scientific scrutiny, so maybe it just sounds kind of weird, some people\'s health suffered for unrelated reasons, and everyone was scared for nothing.\r\n', 'Music-3.jpg', 0, '2022-05-15 04:04:06', '2022-05-15 04:04:06'),

Often, those are the best athletes in the world, but it\'s also possible to game the system, which was how Elizabeth Swaney became an Olympic skier in 2018 despite not being a very good skier at all. \r\nThe first trick that helped Swaney was that the Olympics does not admit, say, the top 300 skiers in the world. If they did, maybe they\'d end up with 100 from the US, 100 from Canada, 100 from Switzerland, and that\'s it, which wouldn\'t be very fun for anyone.

Swaney stood no chance of being one of those four women. But she could compete for Hungary (she had a grandparent from Hungary) since they were otherwise sending no skiers at all.\r\nSo, could she just sign up to represent Hungary and then qualify automatically? No, that would be ridiculous. She had to meet two qualifications—which, when we break them down, are also ridiculous.\r\nFirst, she had to place in the top 30 of a skiing World Cup event. That sounds challenging. But many women\'s World Cup events have fewer than 30 competitors total, which means so long as you take part, you place. Qualifying for these events, it seems, is easy and just a matter of filling up the right forms.\r\nThe second requirement was more complicated. Skiers receive points depending on how well they do in various events during the years leading up to the Olympics, and to qualify for the Olympics, you have to accrue 50 of these FIS points.

It was a round-robin tournament, which meant each team would play each other team twice, in a series of 12 games over the course of 11 days.\r\nIn the second-to-last game, Stade Olympique l\'Emyrne (SOE) was playing Domoina Soavina Atsimondrano (DSA), and the score was 2-2. SOE was still hoping to pull ahead, but the referee, Benjamina Razafintsalama, gave them a penalty, and that was it for them. The final game was going to be SOE against AS ADEMA Analamanga (Adema), but the stakes weren\'t exactly high. With the way, the tournament assigned scores for wins and draws, Adema was now guaranteed the championship, and SOE was guaranteed second place, no matter how the final game went.\r\nSo, while a round-robin may seem like a fair way of running a tournament by setting every single team against every single other, it can wind up pretty anticlimactic compared to your traditional elimination-style brackets. \r\nAre you imagining now that SOE didn\'t even try in the final game, letting Adema beat them 149 to 0? Or that Adema decided they didn\'t need to try, and let SOE score 149 goals and still lose the championship? Neither of those happened. Instead, in the final game on Halloween Night, SOE kicked the ball into their own goal 149 times. This was their protest over what they called the ref\'s bad decision in the previous game. After that first own-goal, Adema didn\'t even bother trying to get the ball. They quickly realized what was happening and just stood back and let SOE do their thing. \r\nLike so many protests, this accomplished nothing (it\'s unclear what SOE was even hoping would happen). In fact, the league punished them by taking away even their second-place title, barred them from a future tournament, suspended some players for the rest of the season, and suspended the coach for three years. The protest also won them absolutely no new fans. Spectators that day swarmed the ticket office, demanding refunds because they had come for a game, not whatever this was.

(24, 5, 5, 'If You’re Contouring With Bronzer, You’re Doing It Wrong', 'If you already have a solid bronzer in your beauty arsenal, do you really need a contour, too? Short answer: yes. Most of us are guilty of using bronzer and contour interchangeably, but the truth is, they serve completely different purposes. Here’s everything you need to know.\r\nThe difference between bronzer and contour\r\nBronzer adds warmth to your complexion, so you look like you just spent days soaking up the sun on a tropical getaway. Contour, on the other hand, adds dimension and shadows to sculpt the face.\r\nBronzer and contour shades and finishes\r\nBronzer typically has warmer undertones—like orange, red, and yellow—and is available in matte and shimmer finishes to add a sunkissed glow, while contour features neutral, cool-toned undertones in a matte finish.\r\nApplying bronzer and contour\r\nContour mimics shadows, so you want to apply it under the cheekbones, the jawlines, temples, and the sides of the nose to shape and define your facial structure. Bronzer should be applied anywhere the sun would naturally hit your face on a bright day—on the cheekbones, across the forehead, and along the bridge of the nose.\r\nChoosing between bronzer and contour\r\nWhile both bronzer and contour add depth and enhance your complexion, they both deserve a spot in your makeup routine for different reasons. Wear them alone or let them work together (contour first, then bronzer) to sculpt your structure and warm your complexion—they aren’t mutually exclusive.', 'Beauty-1.jpg', 1, '2022-05-15 04:33:15', '2022-05-15 04:33:15'),
(25, 9, 5, 'Are There Beauty Goodies Hiding in Your Trash or Compost Pile?', 'One person’s trash is another’s…beauty treasure? Yes, it’s true! At this very moment, your garbage can might contain a slew of skincare goodies you’re putting to waste. So, before you take out the trash, check this list first to uncover the many added benefits of disposables (like eggshells and coffee grinds), and then reuse, reuse, reuse! And they say our culture is wasteful.\r\nCoffee grounds\r\nUses: face or body scrub, cellulite treatment, eye de-puffer\r\nCaffeine not only gives you a jolt in the morning, but it can also reawaken your skin’s cell growth, too. Use your old grounds (cooled to room temp, of course) as a mild exfoliant for your face and body—the grainy texture will slough off dead cells to reveal a fresh complexion. Add a bit of sugar if you want a deeper scrub, or some oil if you prefer more moisturizing. Buffing with coffee grounds is also said to reduce the appearance of cellulite by promoting circulation—so drink an extra cup so you have extra for your thighs! Puffy eyes? Coffee can help with that, too. Place some grounds under your eyes for a few minutes and rinse off for a fresh, alert look.\r\nBanana peels\r\nUses: acne treatment, teeth whitener, skin soother, hydrating facial mask\r\nAs we’ve mentioned before, banana peels are incredible for helping to fight acne. Simply cut a small piece of peel and rub the inside over the affected areas a few times a day, and you should see results in about a week. Doing the same thing on your teeth for a minute each day may also help whiten your smile. But that’s not all—banana peels can also help bring relief when applied over warts, bug bites, or psoriasis outbreaks. And a really quick trick for a moisturizing facial applies several strips of peel to cover your entire face, leave it on for an hour, and voilà! Instant radiance.\r\nEggshells\r\nUses: facial mask, acne spot treatment, nail art embellishment\r\nWe all know how great eggs are in DIY hair and face masks—and the shells can help moisturize and replenish the appearance and texture of the skin. Take a few and create a speck of fine dust (either grind in a food processor or use a mallet and sealed plastic baggie). Then add some water and an egg white to the dust, whisk until blended, and apply to the face. Let it dry, then rinse off. Your skin will feel tighter, smoother, and refreshed. Another trick: peel off the super-thin skin on the inside of an eggshell, and apply to a blemish or patch of blackheads. After it dries, peel it off, and rinse—it has an exfoliating and skin-clearing effect. And lastly, and perhaps most unexpectedly, you can use shell pieces in nail art! Create a mosaic effect over polish or a natural base, and seal in with a topcoat. This especially makes sense around Easter, when you have beautifully dyed shells you’d normally toss.\r\nWine corks\r\nUse: smokey eyeliner (stay with us!)\r\nSome people use old wine bottles for vases, but did you know that the cork can actually be used for eyeliner? It might sound old school but you can use this trick to get perfectly kohl-rimmed, smoky eyes in a pinch. Let us preface this tutorial by saying we highly suggest you do this way before you’ve had a few—the trick involves fire after all. Ready? All you have to do is simply burn the cork with a lighter for a second, then blow it out to extinguish! Let it cool for 30 seconds, and then lightly use it to smoke around the eyes! It must be something about the cork material creating a nice smudge-able ash, but it really works. We first learned the trick from Courtney Cox, in her old column for Jane magazine. And she demonstrated it on the Rosie O’Donnell Show back in the day (the demo starts at 8:00).', 'Beauty-2.jpg', 1, '2022-05-15 04:37:24', '2022-05-15 04:37:24'),

Celebrity nutritionist Kimberly Snyder gives us a recipe for a probiotic and enzyme salad—the perfect meal to re-balance your digestive system and give you clear, glowing skin. Made from raw sauerkraut —which is fermented cabbage—the salad is full of probiotics (good bacteria), B vitamins, and enzymes (which help to maintain a healthy gut). “Probiotics have been associated with helping to keep the growth of unfavorable bacteria, yeast, and fungi in check, which keeps immunity strong, and promotes good digestion,” says Kim. Another positive? “When your intestinal flora and stomach is balanced, it equals clear, beautiful skin.” Sauerkraut is also high in B vitamins, which are important for helping your body to process food into energy. “I recommend eating at least half a cup daily at dinner,” says Kim.\r\nProbiotic & Enzyme Salad\r\nBase Ingredients:\r\n1 medium green cabbage, shredded in a food processor or finely sliced by hand\r\n6 of the large outer leaves of cabbage, intact\r\nLiquid Brine Mixture Ingredients:\r\n4 cups water\r\n4 inches ginger root, peeled and grated\r\n1 Tbsp unpasteurized miso paste\r\nDIRECTIONS\r\nPlace the shredded green cabbage in a large mixing bowl and put to the side. Blend the liquid brine mixture in your blender until smooth, and pour over the shredded cabbage. Mix well. Tightly pack the mixture into clean glass jars using a wooden spoon. Leave two inches of room at the top of the jars so the salad has room to expand. Fold a few of the outer cabbage leaves into very tight rolls, and place them on top of the mixture to fill that two-inch space. Tightly seal the jars.\r\nLeave the jars in your pantry for five days. Be sure the room temperature is around 65 to 70 degrees. If it is slightly colder, wrap a towel around each jar and keep it in the pantry. After five days, remove the outer cabbage leaves and discard them. Move the jars to the refrigerator. Bubbling is a good sign that healthy probiotics are teeming.\r\nUnveil your probiotic & enzyme salad and enjoy at least half a cup at dinner every night—and also at lunch when possible. Once the seal has been broken on each jar, the salad will keep fresh in the refrigerator for up to one month.\r\nNote: Purchase Kim\'s book, The Beauty Detox Solution, between January 2-8 and email your receipt to contest@kimberlysnyder.net for a chance to win a free consultation with Kim!', 'Beauty-3.jpg', 0, '2022-05-15 04:37:24', '2022-05-15 04:37:24'),

(33, 4, 3, 'A Singular American Painter and His Perennially Disregarded Wife', 'HARTFORD, Conn. — There has always been a certain fluidity in our appreciation of the American modernist maverick Milton Avery (1885-1965). And this is not just because of the light, airy, daringly simplified, almost abstract paintings of sand, sea, and sky that characterized his last decade. Avery was artistically unaffiliated, never part of a particular group or movement, which means that general awareness of his work has fluctuated a great deal. It’s always surprising to realize the range of his styles and subjects, and the chance to do so has been too rare.\r\nNow, one of those rare moments has arrived, with quite a bit of Avery’s work on view in shows in New York City and Hartford, Conn. It is the largest since the artist’s retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1982 and as a sidebar to these shows, the painter from Brooklyn who married Avery in 1926. She worked full-time as a freelance illustrator for more than 30 years so that he could paint full time. Her painting style has been seen as a knockoff of her husband’s, but her contribution to its formation has yet to be fully recognized, especially his tendency to distill forms to their essence.\r\nThe Wadsworth show begins on a cringe note. Its first work is a small oil on board from around 1910 that features tufts of yellow and green leafy brushwork supported by trunks and branches whose skinny, brittle lines suggest the use of a quill pen. If that painting promises anything, it’s a future in greeting card design. But Avery, whose simplified use of flat, saturated color would influence fledgling Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, and Barnett Newman, virtually acknowledged the problem: He called the scene “Spindly Trees” and went on to use lines more loosely and inventively, making them a staple of his radiant, notational art.', 'Art-3.jpg', 1, '2022-05-15 04:52:09', '2022-05-15 04:52:09'),
